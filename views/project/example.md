# Example Project Page
### This is an example of the "Example" project in the "Project" directory

The MD file format in the "Project" directory will not have its title auto applied to the page, or a date timestamp,
and will display it's own data, or just embed directly the project/info it so chooses.
The layout `layout/base.ejs` can be used to render a page without the built in auto breadcrumb feature.

[Here](/blog/example) is a link to the equivalent "Blog" page.
